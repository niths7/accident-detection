# accident-detection
This project implements an Accident Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and real-time video processing techniques. The system detects potential accidents in traffic scenarios, estimates their severity, and facilitates rapid response to mitigate risks

# Key Features:

CNN-based model for accident detection trained on a dataset of traffic scenario images.
Real-time video processing application developed using OpenCV for on-the-fly accident detection.
Integration with emergency services for automatic alerting and provision of accident details.
Advanced sensor integration for enhanced detection accuracy and situational awareness.
User-friendly interfaces for video input selection, monitoring, and result visualization.

# Future Work:

Estimation of accident fatality based on impact severity and other factors.
Integration with additional sensors such as LiDAR and radar for comprehensive situational awareness.
Real-time traffic management capabilities for optimizing traffic flow and mitigating accident risks.

# Benefits:

Enhances road safety by promptly identifying potential accidents and estimating their severity.
Facilitates rapid response and assistance from emergency services, minimizing accident consequences.
Contributes to a safer and more efficient transportation system, benefiting society as a whole.
